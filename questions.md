What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

0(1) to 0(n) main runtime depending on accessing a specific element or random element, adding or removing from front 0(1) and from the back is 0(1) or 0(n) if the space is full.

What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

0(n) to copy over the old array over to the new one
